## Provider Configuration Storage

Twinny offers flexibility in how your provider configurations are stored. You can manage this using the `twinny.providerStorageLocation` setting in your VS Code `settings.json`.

Available options:

*   `"globalState"`: (Default) Stores provider configurations in VS Code's global state. This is tied to the current workspace/domain and might be lost if the domain changes frequently (e.g., in some code-server setups or when connecting to different remote environments).
*   `"file"`: Stores provider configurations in a JSON file (`twinny-providers.json`) within the extension's dedicated global storage directory. This method is more resilient to domain changes and is recommended for users experiencing issues with settings persistence or those who prefer file-based configuration management.

Upon first switching to `"file"`, Twinny will attempt to migrate any existing configurations from `globalState` to the new `twinny-providers.json` file.

### Importing and Exporting Providers

You can easily manage your provider configurations by importing and exporting them through the Twinny settings UI (accessible via the Twinny icon in the activity bar, then navigating to the "Providers" tab).

*   **Export Providers Button:** Clicking this button allows you to save all your current Twinny provider configurations into a single JSON file. You will be prompted to choose a name and location for this file. This is useful for backing up your settings or transferring them to another workspace or machine.
*   **Import Providers Button:** This button enables you to load provider configurations from a previously exported JSON file. When you select a valid JSON file, its contents will **replace** all your current provider configurations.
    *   **Caution:** Importing will overwrite your existing settings. If you want to keep your current setup, it's advisable to export it first as a backup before importing new configurations.

The expected file format for both import and export is a JSON object where each key is a unique provider ID, and the value is an object representing the provider's settings.
