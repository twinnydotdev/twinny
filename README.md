# twinny

**twinny** is a locally hosted AI code completion plugin for Visual Studio Code, designed to work seamlessly with [ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama).

**🎉 Attention: twinny now works only with [ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) API and the legacy API [twinny-api](https://github.com/rjmacarthy/twinny-api) will no longer be supported.**
