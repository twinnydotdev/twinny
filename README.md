# twinny

<br>

Are you fed up of all of those so called "Free" Copilot alternatives with paywalls and signups?  Fear not my developer friend!  Twinny is the most no-nonsense locally hosted (or api hosted) AI code completion plugin for vscode designed to work seamlessly with [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama). Like Github Copilot but 100% free and 100% private.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Easy Installation

twinny and [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) are designed to work together. When installing the twinny extension in Visual Studio Code, it will automatically prompt and guide you through the installation of Ollama using two default small models `codellama:7b-instruct` for chat and `codellama:7b-code` for "fill in the middle".

You can install the verified extension at [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rjmacarthy.twinny)

When the extension is running and the Ollama server is running you will see a `🤖` icon at the bottom of your code editor which indicates which models are running.

That's it! Enjoy enhanced code completions and chat with twinny! 🎉

## Supported Ollama models

- codellama `instruct` for chat and `code` for FIM. (https://ollama.ai/library/codellama)
- deepseek-coder for both chat and FIM (https://ollama.ai/library/deepseek-coder)
- phind-codellama for chat (https://ollama.ai/library/phind-codellama)

For FIM - The model must support the llama or deepseek special tokens for prefix and suffix.
For chat - All llama models should work, although any model will probably work too, results may vary if the special tokens are different from Llama.
