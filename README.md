### Workspace Embeddings
Enhance your coding experience with context-aware AI assistance using workspace embeddings.
- **Embed Your Workspace**: Easily embed your entire workspace with a single click.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: twinny uses relevant parts of your codebase to provide more accurate and contextual answers.
- **Customizable Embedding Provider**: By default, uses Ollama Embedding (all-minilm:latest), but supports various providers.
- **Adjustable Relevance**: Fine-tune the rerank probability threshold to control the inclusion of context in AI responses.
- **Toggle Embedded Context**: Easily switch between using embedded context or not for each message.

### Symmetry network
[Symmetry](https://twinny.dev/symmetry) is a decentralized peer-to-peer network tool designed to democratize access to computational resources for AI inference. Key features include:

- Resource Sharing: Users can offer or seek computational power for various AI tasks.
- Direct Connections: Enables secure, peer-to-peer connections between users.
- Visual Studio Code Integration: Twinny has built-in functionality to connect as a peer or provider directly within VS Code.
- Public Provider Access: Users can leverage models from other users who are public providers on the Symmetry network.

Symmetry aims to make AI inference more accessible and efficient for developers and researchers.

The client source code is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/twinnydotdev/symmetry-core).
